### Assignments

There will be assignments after every lecture. You will submit them via GitHub. I'll explain the details during the lectures.

### Project

Towards the end of the course you'll be asked to do a project.
First you will need to submit a proposal for the project and when it is accepted then implement it.
The project should be something that is useful for your studies or at least it is fun for you to make.
Ask in the lab where you work what needs are there that you might implement as your final project.
You can get inspiration from the projects [listed here](https://code-maven.com/programming-bootcamp-for-scientists)
and the [projects of the 2023 autumn semester](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-bootcamp-2023-12)
or those of [2024 spring semester](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-course-2024-04).

The idea of the project is that you write something that is going to be useful for you beyond the course. e.g. There is some manual work in your lab and this project will automate it.
It can be also a tool to help you with your research. etc. It can also be useful in your private life. e.g. we had projects trying to register for visa applications at the USA embasy
and also games.

**How to submit your proposal?**

* Create a separate repository for the project. Its name should reflect the project: (e.g. Gene-Amplification-and-SNP-Analysis) and not the the course.
If someone looks at this repository they should see it as a real application and not "some stuff you wrote just to get the grade".

* The proposal should be the README.md file of the repository. If you need to include images or data files, those should be also included in the repository.
It should be a description that will help any future visitor of the project to understand

1. What does this project do?
1. What kind of input data it expects and what kind out output the user might expect.
1. The technicalities: How to download it, install the dependencies, run the tests, and run the project?

It would be nice if at the end of the README you mention that this was written as part of the course and link to the course repository.

We understand that the project and thus the description might evolve during the implementation. That's fine. You can update the README with the new information. In the proposal we would like to see your understanding of the project before you start implementing it.

Before you submit it for approval it is recommended that you send it to another student and ask if the description is clear. If that student has any questions then you probably will need to update the README to answer those questions so the next person won't need to ask.

Once you are ready, open an issue on our repository linking to you project to get it approved.

Once the project is approved you will implement it in the same repository. Open a new issue when you'd like the project to be graded.



### Expected workload

In addition to the lectures you will spend about 2-4 hours / week on the assignments and 20-40 hours on the project.

The actual time spent will greatly depend on your previous experience with programming in general and Python in particular.

The time you spend on the project will also depend on the availability of the data you work on.
If you pick a project that you would want to do anyway then this is basically time you would spend anyway.


### Grades

* Each assignment counts as 5% (we will have 10 of them).
* The project proposal is 15%.
* The project is 35%.

* The project is a requirement. Without that you won't get a passing grade.

### Slides

During the course I'll use some of the [slides that can be found here](https://slides.code-maven.com/python/).
These slides are publicly available and will remain on the web site after the course is over.

### Videos in English

There are [recording of this course from 3 years ago](https://code-maven.com/programming-bootcamp-for-scientists).

There are also [recordings from the 2023 autumn semester](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-bootcamp-2023-12).

There are also [recordings from the 2024 spring semester](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-course-2024-04).

You can watch those, but be also warned, this semester the order of the material will be different.

There are many more videos in my [English-language YouTube channel](https://code-maven.com/youtube).
You are invited to check them out and to follow the channel.

### Videos in Hebrew

Some of the material is also available in Hebrew. You can find them [on my website](https://he.code-maven.com/)
and in my [Hebrew-language YouTube channel](https://he.code-maven.com/youtube). You are invited to
follow that channel as well.

### Language

The default teaching language of WIS and of this course is English.

In writing please stick to English.

If and when we have one-on-one conversions I'd be happy to speak in Hebrew, Hungarian, Spanish, or Ladino as well.

### Bring your own computer!

* Write a python program that has two variables `width` and `length` of a rectangle. Print out the area and the circumference of the rectangle. (`rectangle.py`)
* Write a python program that has one variable `radius` of a circle. Print out the area and the circumference of the circle. (`cricle.py`)
* Create a Jupyter Notebook that has 3 variables `width` and `length` of a rectangle and the `radius` of a circle. Print out the area and circumference of both.  (`day2.ipynb`)

* Create a new repository for the assignments (e.g. call it python-assignments) create a folder called day02 and upload the 3 files to that folder.
* Add a README.md file to the root of the repository with some information explaining what is in the repository.

### Assignment (day 4)

* Create a folder called `day04`.

We did not go over the while loops but for this assignment you will need it. It is used when we don't have anything to iterate overknow or we don't know up front how many iteration we will have.
You can use `break` and `continue` in the `while` loops as well:
You car write it like this:

```
while True:
    if some_condition:
        break
    ...
```

* Write a Python program that is a number guessing game:
    * The computer "thinks" a about a whole number between 1 and 20
    * The user guesses
    * The computer tells if the guess was too small, too big or exact.
    * If exact the user wins, the program ends. Otherwise the user can guess again.
    * At the end of the game print out how many guesses the user needed.

    * Allow the user to play several games: once one game ends ask her if she wants to play again, generate a new random number and play again.
    * If the user enters "x" any time, exit the program.
    * If the user enters "n" any time, leave the current game and ask if she wants to play a new game?
    * If the user enters "s" any time, show the hidden number (cheating).
    * Move the code in a function called `main` and split up the code into several function that make sense.


There is a file called `day04/assignment-t-test.ipynb` copy it and follow the instructions in the file.

### Assignment (day 6)

Create a folder called `day06`.

Write a command line tool that can download data from NCBI. You can download from the nucleotide database
as we did in the lecture, but it would be much more interesting if you used some of the other databases
available on NCBI. e.g.:

```
python ncbi.py  --database nucleotide --term TERM --number NUMBER
```

The database can default to "nucleotide", ther number can default to 10.


Search for the TERM and download up to NUMBER items. Save each item in its own file. Print the names of the files.
Also save the date, the database, the search term, the number asked for and the total number of items found in a csv file. So if you run the command twice:

```
python ncbi.py  --database genome --term Orchid --number 3
python ncbi.py  -cauliflower
```

you'd get something like this:

```
date,term,max,total
2024-05-30 17:20:21,genome,Orchid,3,527341
2024-05-30 18:12:34,nucleotide,cauliflower,10,32781
```

Copy the file `day06/Assignment06.ipynb` and follow the instructions there.

### Assignment (day 8)

* Take one of the previous programs you wrote and create either a GUI for it using Tk or a Web interface for it using Flask.

For example you can take the number guessing game and convert it to work in either GUI or web. You could also take some interesting biological process or computation, implement it and add  GUI or web interface to it.
