### Assignments

There will be assignments after every lecture. You will submit them via GitHub. I'll explain the details during the lectures.

### Project

Towards the end of the course you'll be asked to do a project.
First you need to submit a proposal for the project and when it is accepted then implement it.
The project should be something that is useful for your studies or at least it is fun for you to make.
Ask in the lab where you work what needs are there that you might implement as your final project.
You can get inspiration from the projects [listed here](https://code-maven.com/programming-bootcamp-for-scientists)
and the [projects of the 2023 autumn semester](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-bootcamp-2023-12)
or those of [2024 spring semester](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-course-2024-04).

### Expected workload

In addition to the lectures you will spend about 2-4 hours / week on the assignments and 20-40 hours on the project.

The actual time spent will greatly depend on your previous experience with programming in general and Python in particular.

The time you spend on the project will also depend on the availability of the data you work on.
If you pick a project that you would want to do anyway then this is basically time you would spend anyway.


### Grades

* Each assignment counts as 5% (we will have 10 of them).
* The project proposal is 15%.
* The project is 35%.

* The project is a requirement. Without that you won't get a passing grade.

### Slides

During the course I'll use some of the [slides that can be found here](https://slides.code-maven.com/python/).
These slides are publicly available and will remain on the web site after the course is over.

### Videos in English

There are [recording of this course from 3 years ago](https://code-maven.com/programming-bootcamp-for-scientists).

There are also [recordings from the 2023 autumn semester](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-bootcamp-2023-12).

There are also [recordings from the 2024 spring semester](https://github.com/szabgab/wis-python-course-2024-04).

You can watch those, but be also warned, this semester the order of the material will be different.

There are many more videos in my [English-language YouTube channel](https://code-maven.com/youtube).
You are invited to check them out and to follow the channel.

### Videos in Hebrew

Some of the material is also available in Hebrew. You can find them [on my website](https://he.code-maven.com/)
and in my [Hebrew-language YouTube channel](https://he.code-maven.com/youtube). You are invited to
follow that channel as well.

### Language

The default teaching language of WIS and of this course is English.

In writing please stick to English.

If and when we have one-on-one conversions I'd be happy to speak in Hebrew, Hungarian, Spanish, or Ladino as well.

### Bring your own computer!

You are expected to bring your own computer to the lectures.

### Installations

There is no need to install anything up front. We'll do that during the lectures.
