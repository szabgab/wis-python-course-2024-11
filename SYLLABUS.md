# Basic programming skills (Python)

This is a beginner course suitable for anyone wanting to process scientific data with minimal or no prior knowledge.

## Course objectives:

* To be able to write programs in Python.
* To master the rich set of Python libraries and modules.
* Understand procedural control flow in Python

## Course format:

* The course includes presentations, assignments, and a final project.

## Prerequisites:
* Experience with a text editor similar to notepad.
* Understanding of files and directories.

## Version control with git and using GitHub

* Dealing with projects on GitHub.  (eg. biopython)
* Creating GitHub pages.
* Writing nice documents using Markdown.






## Introduction to Computers and Programming

* What is programming?
* The parts of a computer and a mobile phone
* Different types of programming languages: Compiled vs. Interpreted
* Programming paradigms: imperative, procedural, oop, declarative, functional, logic, mathematical.
* Software licensing model (Closed Source, Share-ware, Open Source, Free Software)
* Software distribution model (packaged, service, application).
* Single core, multi core, cluster
* Complexity - run time, memory usage

## Development and runtime environment in Python and elsewhere

* Various ways to write Python code

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - application development.
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook - Analyzing data in an interactive way
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and the command line.
* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)

* Running from the IDE vs. the command line vs. on a server vs. in a cluster.
* Compare the above with Matlab.

## The Scientific libraries

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* Comparing with Matlab and R
