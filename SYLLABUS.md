# Basic programming skills (Python)

This is a beginner course suitable for anyone wanting to process scientific data with minimal or no prior knowledge.

## Course objectives:

* To be able to write programs in Python.
* To master the rich set of Python libraries and modules.
* Understand procedural control flow in Python

## Course format:

* The course includes presentations, assignments, and a final project.

## Prerequisites:
* Experience with a text editor similar to notepad.
* Understanding of files and directories.

## Introduction to Computers and Programming

* The parts of a computer and a mobile phone
* Different types of programming languages: Compiled vs. Interpreted
* Programming paradigms: imperative, procedural, oop, declarative, functional, logic, mathematical.
* Software licensing model (Closed Source, Share-ware, Open Source, Free Software)
* Software distribution model (packaged, service, application).
* Single core, multi core, cluster
* Complexity - run time, memory usage

## Development and runtime environment in Python and elsewhere

* Notepad++ and the command line.
* VS Code
* PyCharm
* Jupyter notebook
* Spider
* Running from the IDE vs. the command line vs. on a server vs. in a cluster.
* Compare the above with Matlab.

## The Scientific libraries

* Substitution

## The Python standard library

* Filesystem related functions
* Running external processes

## Creating modules

* Loading a module
* Finding a module in a private directory
* Changing the search path to a relative directory
* Importing selected functions
* Namespaces
* Creating executable module

## Exception handling

* Creating non-fatal warnings
* Catching exceptions
* Handling exceptions
* Throwing a new exception
* The final block
* Creating your own exception

## Additional uses

* Installing and using 3rd party modules
* Writing simple web scraping program
* Writing a simple Web application
* Accessing SQL databases
* Reading and writing Excel files

## Extra topics:

* Basic complexity calculation.
